## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile first workflow

### What I've learned

I learned to use the Mobile first concept and I also learned to use transform to locate and place the content box in the ideal place.

### Ongoing development

I will continue to improve my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3. I'm already learning the basics of Javascript and soon I'll start my projects using these three technologies, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
